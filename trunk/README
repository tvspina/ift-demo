Type make to compile the ift1.0 library

In demo you will find several subdirectories. Type make followed by
the basename of the program to compile each program. Example:

cd demo/watershed
make watershed

By typing the name of the program, you will see its usage. Example:

watershed

In this case, the correct usage is

watershed flower.pgm flower_grad.pgm flower-seeds.txt

All directories come with image files and other information, and
needed, to execute the programs. Enjoy. The algorithms are following
the lectures in www.ic.unicamp.br/~afalcao/talks

Enjoy it and do not hesitate to ask me help.

Alexandre Falcao.
